  //There are two associated monads, MonadTell and MonadListen

  //A popular specialisation of WriterT is when the monad is Id, meaning the underlying run value is just a simple tuple (W, A).

  When using the Writer monad, you have to be careful which monoid to use, because using lists can sometimes turn out to be very slow. Thatâ€™s because lists use ++ for mappend and using ++ to add something to the end of a list is slow if that list is really long.
